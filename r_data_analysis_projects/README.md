# R Data Analysis Projects

Welcome to my `r_data_analysis_projects` folder! This directory contains a collection of projects completed using the R programming language. Each project is organized into its own folder and showcases my proficiency in data analysis, visualization, statistical modeling, and more using R.

## Projects List

### Behavioral Risk Factor Project
- **Files:** `brfss_part1.qmd`, `brfss_part2.qmd`, `brfss2015.csv`, `brfss_codebook.pdf`
- **Description:** This project analyzes the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) 2015 data. It is divided into two parts, with Part 1 focusing on data preparation and practice exercises, and Part 2 delving into in-depth analysis and interpretation of health-related variables. The project includes the dataset (`brfss2015.csv`) and a codebook (`brfss_codebook.pdf`) for reference, showcasing advanced R programming skills in data cleaning, statistical analysis, and visualization.

### Cluster Analysis Employees Project
- **Files:** `cluster_analysis_employees.R`, `employees.csv`, `employees_kmeans_4clusters.csv`
- **Description:** Demonstrates K-means and hierarchical cluster analysis using an employee dataset. This project showcases my skills in clustering techniques and the interpretation of clusters related to employee job satisfaction and attrition.

### Food Nutrition Analysis Project
- **Files:** `fastfood.qmd`, `fastfood_stats.qmd`
- **Description:** This project involves the detailed nutritional analysis of fast food items from prominent chains. The analysis emphasizes data manipulation, exploratory data analysis, and statistical modeling, including correlation and regression, to identify patterns in the dataset.

### Linear Regression Project
- **Files:** `linear_regression_for_business.R`, `credit.csv`, `credit_card_prediction.csv`
- **Description:** A multiple linear regression analysis project using a dataset of credit card holders to predict credit card balances. The project focuses on model creation, interpretation, and the use of regression techniques to make business predictions.

### Logistic Regression Project
- **Files:** `logistic_regression_insurance.R`, `insurance.csv`, `insurance_predictions.csv`
- **Description:** This project involves performing logistic regression analysis on car insurance customer data. The aim is to predict the likelihood of customers making insurance claims based on specific characteristics, showcasing predictive modeling skills.

### Mammalian Sleep Analysis Project
- **Files:** `msleep.qmd`, `msleep_stats.qmd`
- **Description:** This project explores and analyzes mammalian sleep patterns using the msleep dataset. It involves data manipulation, statistical computation, and modeling to understand relationships between sleep, diet, and body weight across various animal orders.

### NYC Statistical Analysis Project
- **Files:** `nycflights13.qmd`, `nycflights13_stats.qmd`
- **Description:** An exploration and analysis of the NYC Flights 2013 dataset. The project includes data manipulation, analysis of flight patterns, delays, and distances, as well as regression analysis to predict flight delays. The project highlights skills in transforming real-world datasets into meaningful insights.

### Pizza Statistical Analysis Project
- **Files:** `pizza.qmd`, `pizza_stats.qmd`, `pizza.csv`
- **Description:** Analyzes pizza delivery data to explore patterns related to free wine distribution, customer discounts, and order sizes. The project employs data manipulation, correlation, and regression analyses to derive insights into the operational efficiency and promotional strategies of a pizza delivery service.

### Time Series Analysis Project
- **Files:** `time_series_analysis.R`, `airfare.csv`, `warner_music.csv`, `amazon_web_services.csv`
- **Description:** A project that conducts time series analysis to forecast trends in various industries, including airfare and quarterly revenue. This project demonstrates expertise in time series forecasting, model evaluation, and the application of these models to real-world business scenarios.

## Running the Projects

Projects are R scripts or R Markdown documents that can be viewed directly on GitHub or run locally in RStudio. Data files associated with each project are included within the respective project folders.
