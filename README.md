# DataSciencePortfolio
A collection of my data science projects and Python scripts

## Data Manipulation Projects
A collection of projects focused on data processing, manipulating, aggregating, grouping, multi-indexing, and function creating to prepare data for training and testing.

## MachineLearningProject
An end-to-end machine learning project that analyzes student data and creates a machine learning model to predict a student's performance based on select features. The stakeholders are the school's leadership, who hope to use the model(s) to identify students who need additional assistance and interventions to improve their grade. 

- PredictingStudentGrades.ipynb: A Python notebook containing the technical implementation of the project. It includes code and markdown blocks detailing the data cleaning, analysis, feature scaling, custom transformations, training and testing of models, model selection, and performance metrics.
- ExecutiveSummary_StudentsGrades.docx: A word document containing the executive summary to communicate to the stakeholders the gained insights, present visualizations, and suggest next steps.
- student-mat.csv: The dataset was downloaded from [UC Irvineâ€™s machine learning repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/320/student+performance) and modified for this
assignment. It contains student performance data from two Portuguese schools, originally
collected from school reports and questionnaires.
