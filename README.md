# DataSciencePortfolio
A comprehensive collection of my data science projects, Python scripts, and R projects. This portfolio showcases my skills in data manipulation, machine learning, statistical analysis, and proficiency with various programming languages and tools.

## Data Manipulation Projects
A collection of projects focused on data processing, manipulation, aggregation, grouping, multi-indexing, and function creation. These projects prepare data for training, testing, and other analysis purposes.

- **[data_manipulation_projects](./data_manipulation_projects)**: Includes various projects demonstrating data manipulation techniques using Python libraries such as Pandas and NumPy.

## Machine Learning Project
An end-to-end machine learning project that builds and evaluates models to predict student performance based on various features. The project is designed to assist school leadership in identifying students who may need additional support.

- **[machine_learning_project](./machine_learning_project)**: Detailed information about this project can be found in the README within this folder.

## Python Fundamentals
A collection of Python scripts and notebooks showcasing my proficiency with common Python libraries (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, scikit-learn) and function creation.

- **[python_fundamentals](./python_fundamentals)**: Contains Python notebooks and scripts focusing on foundational Python skills, including array manipulation, data processing, and algorithmic problem-solving.

## R Data Analysis Projects
A collection of R-specific projects that demonstrate proficiency in data analysis, data manipulation, exploratory analysis, statistical analysis, data visualization, predictive modeling, regression analysis, and interpretation of analysis results.

- **[r_data_analysis_projects](./r_data_analysis_projects)**: Includes various projects performed using R, each organized into its own folder with associated data files and analysis scripts.
