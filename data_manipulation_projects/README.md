# Data Manipulation Projects

This folder contains a series of projects focused on data processing, manipulation, aggregation, grouping, and preparation for machine learning tasks. Each project showcases different aspects of data manipulation and provides a solid foundation for more advanced analysis.

## Projects List

### 1. Halloween Candy Project
- **Files:** `candy.csv`, `halloween_candy.ipynb`
- **Overview:** 
  This project involves cleaning and wrangling data from the 2017 Halloween Candy Hierarchy survey. The data has been modified slightly from its original version and includes messy free-text fields, making it an excellent example of real-world data cleaning challenges. The end goal is to prepare the data for a machine learning model aimed at predicting a person's gender based on their candy preferences.

### 2. LEGO Inventory Project
- **Files:** `colors.csv`, `elements.csv`, `inventories.csv`, `inventory_minifigs.csv`, `inventory_parts.csv`, `inventory_sets.csv`, `lego_inventory_project.ipynb`, `lego_schema.png`, `minifigs.csv`, `part_categories.csv`, `part_relationships.csv`, `parts.csv`, `sets.csv`, `themes.csv`
- **Overview:**
  This project loads multiple tables from the Rebrickable website to perform data analysis on LEGO sets and parts. The project involves data aggregation, grouping, function creation, and working with multi-indexing. The schema provided offers a visual representation of how the tables are interrelated. The goal is to explore the data and understand the relationships between different LEGO components.

### 3. NYC Payroll Project
- **Files:** `data_dictionary.xlsx`, `nyc_payroll_analysis.ipynb`
- **Overview:**
  This project uses payroll data downloaded from NYC Open Data to explore the basics of data analysis, focusing on data cleaning and manipulation techniques. The data includes detailed information on NYC employeesâ€™ salary and overtime pay, which is used to analyze the allocation of the City's financial resources. The project addresses challenges such as handling large datasets and mixed data types.

## Running the Projects

All projects are Jupyter notebooks that can be viewed directly on GitHub or run locally. Each project file includes detailed steps for data manipulation, making it easy to follow along or replicate the analysis.
