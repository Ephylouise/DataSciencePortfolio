# R Projects

Welcome to my RProjects folder! This directory contains a collection of projects completed using the R programming language. Each project showcases my proficiency in data analysis, visualization, statistical modeling, and more using R.

## Projects List

- BRFSS2015 Data Analysis (BRFSS_Part1.qmd and BRFSS_Part2.qmd)
Analyzes the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) 2015 data to showcase expertise in **data cleaning**, **statistical analysis**, and **data visualization** techniques. This project is divided into two parts, with Part 1 focusing on data preparation and practice exercises, and Part 2 delving into in-depth analysis and interpretation of health-related variables, demonstrating advanced R programming skills.

- Fast Food Nutritional Analysis (fastfood.qmd)
Conducts a detailed nutritional analysis of fast food items from prominent chains, emphasizing **data manipulation** and **exploratory data analysis** in R. Through tasks like identifying high-calorie items and averaging nutrient contents, this project highlights my ability to work with real-world datasets and derive insightful conclusions, showcasing proficiency in R's `dplyr` and `ggplot2` packages.

- Fast Food Statistical Analysis (fastfoodStats.qmd)
Demonstrates **advanced statistical analysis** and **predictive modeling** in R, focusing on **correlation, regression, and significant predictor identification** within the fastfood dataset. Highlights the adept use of **tidyverse**, **openintro**, and **lm.beta** packages for insightful data exploration and interpretation.

- Mammalian Sleep Dataset Analysis (msleep.qmd)
Explores mammalian sleep patterns using the **msleep** dataset, focusing on **data manipulation** and **statistical computations** within R. This project highlights the effective use of the **tidyverse** package to analyze sleep data across various conservation statuses and animal orders, showcasing skills in summarizing and interpreting complex biological data.

- Mammalian Sleep and Diet Statistical Analysis (msleepStats.qmd)
Delves into statistical relationships in mammalian sleep patterns using **correlation and regression analyses** with the msleep dataset in R. This project emphasizes the ability to apply **tidyverse** for data cleaning, and statistical modeling to understand the impact of sleep on body weight and dietary habits, showcasing a blend of biological insight and data science skills.

- NYC Flights 2013 Data Exploration (nycflights13.qmd)
Investigates the NYC Flights 2013 dataset using nycflights13 and tidyverse packages, focusing on **data manipulation and analysis** to explore flight patterns, delays, and distances. This project highlights skills in **filtering, summarizing, and transforming data** to uncover insights on flight departures, arrivals, and operational discrepancies, showcasing an ability to derive meaningful insights from complex, real-world datasets.

- NYC Flights 2013 Statistical Analysis (nycflights13Stats.qmd)
Applies statistical techniques to the NYC Flights 2013 dataset, focusing on **regression analysis** to predict flight delays. Utilizes tidyverse, nycflights13, and lm.beta packages to **model relationships** between departure delays, distances, and carriers, showcasing the capacity to **extract predictive insights** from flight data.

- Pizza Delivery Data Analysis (pizza.qmd)
Analyzes pizza delivery data to **explore patterns** related to free wine distribution, customer discounts, and order sizes. Utilizes tidyverse for data manipulation, focusing on **calculating ratios, variances, and averages** to derive insights into the operational efficiency and promotional strategies of a pizza delivery service.

- Pizza Delivery Statistical Analysis (pizzaStats.qmd)
Explores **correlations and regression analyses** within a pizza delivery dataset to understand factors influencing wine orders and billing amounts. Employs tidyverse for data preparation and visualization, and lm.beta for **standardized regression coefficients**, aiming to **identify patterns** in temperature, order size, and promotional strategies' **effects on sales outcomes**.
