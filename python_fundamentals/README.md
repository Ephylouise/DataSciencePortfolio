# Python Fundamentals

Welcome to my Python Fundamentals project folder! Here you'll find a variety of projects I've worked on, showcasing my skills in python coding and data analysis.

## NumPy Notebooks

A series of short notebooks focused on NumPy, showcasing various array manipulation, indexing, and operation techniques:

- **array_concatenation.ipynb**: Explores array concatenation, stacking, and splitting techniques.
- **array_indexing.ipynb**: Demonstrates indexing, slicing, and selecting elements within arrays.
- **array_manipulation.ipynb**: Covers array reshaping, sorting, and general manipulation techniques.
- **array_operations.ipynb**: Focuses on basic array operations like creating arrays, and filling values.
- **character_iteration.ipynb**: Discusses iteration over characters and elements in strings and lists.
- **mutable_data_structures.ipynb**: Explores working with mutable data structures like lists in Python.
- **numpy_array_manipulation.ipynb**: Delves into specific NumPy array manipulation techniques.
- **numpy_dictionaries.ipynb**: Combines the use of dictionaries with NumPy arrays, showcasing structured data handling.

## Pandas Notebooks

A series of short notebooks focused on the Pandas library, showcasing data manipulation and analysis techniques:

- **series_df_creation.ipynb**: Basics of Series and DataFrame creation, manipulation, and querying.
- **series_df_indexing.ipynb**: Techniques for Series manipulation and DataFrame indexing.
- **dataframe_slicing.ipynb**: Focuses on DataFrame slicing, selection, and indexing.
- **handling_missing_data.ipynb**: Strategies for managing and imputing missing data.
- **multi_indexing.ipynb**: Explores multi-indexing and data aggregation for complex data structures.

## Python Scripts

This section contains various Python scripts that demonstrate fundamental coding skills, such as data manipulation, algorithm implementation, and problem-solving:

- **arrayargs.py**: Forms a NumPy array from four integers and prints the array's type and product.
- **capCount.py**: Counts capital letters in a string and sums their indices.
- **commonset.py**: Finds and prints common words between two sets.
- **comprehension.py**: Converts and modifies string-typed integers based on divisibility.
- **counter.py**: Maps unique letters in a string to their frequency.
- **count_vowels.py**: Counts unique vowels in a string, case-sensitive.
- **diffset.py**: Identifies unique elements between two lists.
- **duckgoose.py**: Filters elements from a list using comprehension.
- **duplicates.py**: Removes duplicates and sorts a list in descending order.
- **fastfood.py**: Predicts calories using regression analysis on nutritional data.
- **german.py**: Predicts credit amounts with predictive modeling on demographic data.
- **gpacalc.py**: Calculates GPA based on input grades using functions and logic.
- **grades.py**: Computes the average score, excluding a specified subject.
- **inrange.py**: Generates a list of numbers within a range, based on divisibility.
- **loopindex.py**: Adds index values to a list of integers.
- **luke.py**: Determines a character's relationship to Luke Skywalker.
- **palindrome.py**: Checks if a string is a palindrome.
- **presidents.py**: Computes the average height of U.S. presidents using data slicing.
- **randdf.py**: Creates a pandas DataFrame with random integers.
- **reallyrandom.py**: Selects a random value based on input criteria.
- **sacramento.py**: Analyzes housing data with logistic regression.
- **shortest.py**: Finds the shortest word in a string.

- **basic_functions.ipynb**: Demonstrates Python functions for arithmetic, strings, and control structures.
- **string_list_manipulation.ipynb**: Explores string and list manipulations without external libraries.

### Imported Data for Python Scripts

The following datasets are used within the Python scripts listed above:

- **sacramento.csv**: Used in `sacramento.py`.
- **german_credit_data.csv**: Used in `german.py`.
- **fastfood.csv**: Used in `fastfood.py`.
- **president_heights.csv**: Used in `presidents.py`.

## Running the Projects

Many projects are Jupyter notebooks that can be viewed directly on GitHub or run locally. Some projects are programs that run a specific function, many of which accept specific (sys.argv[]) arguements.
